But physicists split atom into sub-atomic particles.\nAtom = proton (p+) + neutron (n) + electron (e-)\nAtomic Number = No. of protonsAtomic Number = No. of protons\nMass Number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons\nAtomic Mass = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons + Mass of electrons\nMass of proton = Mass of neutron ~ 1 DaMass of proton = Mass of neutron ~ 1 Da\nMass of electron = 1/2000 Mass of proton; m (e-) << m (p+)\nSo, Atomic Mass ≈ Mass of protons + Mass of neutronsIsotopes = same atomic number, but different mass number. Eg: 6\n12𝐶,\n6\n13𝐶,\n6\n14𝐶\nA radioactive isotope is one in which nucleus decays spontaneously, emitting particles and energy.Radiation from decaying isotope can damage cellular molecules and thus can pose serious risks to living organisms.But radioactive isotopes can be helpful, as in their use in dating fossils by C-14 decay (t1/2 = 5730 years).Living organisms cannot distinguish between isotopes. So, they uptake both normal and radioactive compounds similarly.Basic research involving radioisotopes: Biologists often use radioactive tracers to follow molecules as they undergo chemicalchanges in an organism. Eg: Monitoring 14CO2 transforming into different metabolites during photosynthesis of carbohydrates\nAtomic structureCaption:The image is a diagram that shows two models of a helium atom. The model on the left is a nucleus, which is a type of atom with two protons and two neutrons. The nucleus is represented by a pinkneutrons. The nucleus is represented by a pink circle with a plus sign in the center, representing the nucleus.On the right side of the image, there is an electron cloud, which represents the nucleus of the atom. Inside the nucleus, there are two electrons, one pink and one black, representing protons. Theone pink and one black, representing protons. The protons are represented by the plus sign, while the neutrons represent the electrons.There is also a note on the image that reads \"Note that these models are not to scale; they greatly overestimate the size of the nucleus in relation to the electron cloud.\" This suggests that theto the electron cloud.\" This suggests that the image is meant to illustrate the relationship between the two models.DNA, not protein contains the genetic code – proven by radioisotope labeling \nGriffith’s experiment (1928) – bacterial transformation\nTwo strains of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae:\n••\nR-strain (rough colonies) – not virulent; did not kill mice\n•\nS-strain (smooth colonies) – virulent; killed infected mice\n•\nHeat-treated S-strain – non-virulent; did not kill mice\n••\nHeat-treated S-strain + R-strain – killed mice; horizontal gene \ntransfer from heat-treated S transformed R-strain to virulent \nstrain\nHershey & Chase experiment (1952) - transductionHershey & Chase experiment (1952) - transduction\nViral DNA was labelled with 32P and protein with 35S. After \nE.coli infection by 32P-labeled phage, radioactivity was foundonly in the transduced bacteria (after the phage are removed \nby agitation and centrifugation). In contrast, after infection \nwith 35S-labeled phage, radioactivity is found only in thesupernatant that remains after the bacteria are removed.Caption: \nThe image is a diagram that shows the process of centrifugation of bacteria in cells. It is divided into two sections.The first section on the left shows a sulfur-labeled protein capsule (red) with a cell inside it. The capsule is labeled as \"bacteriophages\" and the cell inside the capsule is labelled as \"phosphorusinside the capsule is labelled as \"phosphorus labeled DNA (green).In the second section, there is an infection of the bacteria. The infection is represented by a green line that runs from the cell to the cell. The cell is shown in the center of the image.There are three steps in the diagram:\n\n1. Infection\n2. Blending\n3. Centrifugation\n4. After centrifugating no sulfur in cellsAt the bottom of the diagram, there are two circles, one labeled \"cell\" and another labeled \"centrifugal\". The circles are connected by arrows, indicating the direction of the infection. The arrowsthe direction of the infection. The arrows are pointing towards the cells, indicating that the infection is in the process. The diagram also has a label that reads \"1.\"Overall, the image shows how bacteria can be used to differentiate between different types of bacteria and how they interact with each other.Radioactive isotopes in medical diagnosis and treatment\nRadioactive isotopes may also be used to tag chemicals that accumulate in specific areas of the body. Eg: Phosphorus (30P) in \nbones.bones. \n[18F-FDG]Fluorodeoxyglucose is used to detect cancer. After injection of tiny amount of such a tracer, a special camera \nproduces an image of where the radiation collects.Some radioactive isotopes are used for treatment. Eg: The body uses iodine to make a thyroid hormone. Because radioactiveiodine accumulates in the thyroid, it can be used to kill thyroid cancer cells.Substances that the body metabolizes, such as glucose or oxygen, may also be labeled with a radioactive isotope. PET (positron-emission tomography) scan can produce images of areas of the body with high metabolic activity.\nPET is useful for diagnosing certain heart disorders and cancers and for basic \nresearch on the brain.research on the brain.\nAlzheimer is a neurodegenerative disease, wherein the brain becomes riddled \nwith deposits (plaques) of a protein called beta-amyloid. Researchers havesynthesized a radioactively labeled protein molecule called PIB (Carbon-11-\nlabeled Pittsburgh Compound B) that binds to beta-amyloid plaques and can be \ndetected on a PET scan.detected on a PET scan.\nBrain of the Alzheimer’s patient has high levels of PIB (red and yellow areas), \nwhereas the unaffected person’s brain has lower levels (blue).Caption:The image shows two MRI images of the brain, one in blue and the other in yellow. The blue image shows the brain in detail, while the yellow image shows it in color. Both images are labeled with theit in color. Both images are labeled with the text \"Healthy person\" and \"Alzheimer's patient\".The image also includes a text that reads \"Figure 2.4B PET images of brains of a healthy person (left) and a person with Alzheimer's disease (right), Red and yellow colors indicate high levels of PIBRed and yellow colors indicate high levels of PIB bound to beta-amyloid plaques.\" This suggests that the image is related to the study of the human brain and the study's findings.Dangers of radioactive isotopes\nAlthough radioactive isotopes have many beneficial uses, uncontrolled exposure to high levels of radiation can be lethal. Theparticles and energy thrown off by radioactive atoms can damage molecules, especially DNA.Chernobyl nuclear disaster: Explosion of a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 released large amounts of radioactiveisotopes into the environment, which drifted over large areas of Russia, Belarus, and Europe. A few dozen people died fromacute radiation poisoning within a few weeks of the accident, and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area.Increased rates of thyroid cancer in children exposed to the radiation have been reported. 2011 post-tsunami Fukushima nuclear \ndisaster in Japan is another similar incident.disaster in Japan is another similar incident.\nNatural sources of radiation can also pose a threat. Radon, a radioactive gas, is \nthe second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.Radon can contaminate buildings in regions where underlying rocks naturally \ncontain uranium, a radioactive element. Homeowners can buy a radon detectoror hire a company to test their home to ensure that radon levels are safe. If \nlevels are found to be unsafe, technology exists to remove radon from home.Marie Curie (twice awarded Nobel Prize) died of aplastic pernicious anemia \n(body stops producing blood cells) due to her years of exposure to radiation \nduring her work.Caption:The image is a diagram of the Uranium-238 Decay Chain, which is a periodic table that shows the atomic number of the elements in the periodic table.
