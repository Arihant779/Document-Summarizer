Deficiencies can include nutrient deficiencies such as vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and vitamin D. These deficiencies can lead to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In severe cases, these deficiencies can result in serious health problems such as stroke, heart failure, and even death. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for an individual's specific needs.Radioactive isotopes in biology consist of atoms that are separated into sub-atomic particles. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom.Atomic mass = protons + neutrons + electrons. Mass of proton = mass of neutron  1 Da.Mass of proton = Mass of neutron  1 Da mass of electron = 1/2000 Mass of pron; m(e-)  m (p+) So, Atomic Mass  Mass of Protons + Mass of Neutrons.Isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass number. They decay spontaneously and emit particles and energy.Radiation from decaying isotopes can damage cellular molecules and pose serious risks to living organisms.Radioactive isotopes can be helpful in dating fossils by C-14 decay (t1/2 = 5730 years).Living organisms can't distinguish between isotopes, so they take both normal and radioactive compounds.Radioisotopes are used by biologists to monitor the chemical reactions of molecules through radioactive tracers.Changes in an organism include 14CO2 transforming into different metabolites during photosynthesis of carbohydrates, and the atomic structure of the organism.I'm sorry, I cannot summarize an image as I am an AI language model and do not have access to visual content.

Another similar incident is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.Japan's disaster and natural sources of radiation pose a threat. Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the US.Radon can contaminate buildings in areas where underlying rocks contain uranium, a radioactive element. Homeowners can purchase a radon detector.Hire a company to test your home for safe radon levels. If unsafe levels are found, technology can be used to remove it from your home.Marie Curie died of aplastic pernicious anemia due to radiation exposure during her work.

When two atoms have incomplete outer shell electrons, they have a chemical property.Ionic bond: complete electron transfer between two atoms, e.g. NaCl is an example of an ionic bond.Covalent bonds are the sharing of electrons between two atoms, such as H2, O2, CH4, and H2O. Hydrogen bonds are weak bonds between polar molecules that are important in the chemistry of life.Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds in life, including 2H2 + O2 2H2O. The above reaction is an explosive reaction, but it does not occur in cells.Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O hvC6H12O6 + 6O2 Aerobic respiration: 6H6O6+6O2 6CO2+6H4O + ATP.I'm sorry, I cannot summarize an image as I am an AI language model and do not have access to visual content. Please provide me with a text-based instruction or question.The diagram explains the equation for photosynthesis in plants and shows the oxidation-reduction reaction where H2O donates electrons for the reduction of CO2.Electrons act as hydrogen to reduce CO2 to carbonhydrate (CH2O) in the process of photosynthesis.The diagram shows the process of photosynthesis in the atmosphere of a plant, with a sun with carbon dioxide.The sun has a carbon dioxide molecule in the center, representing the energy of the sun. The molecule is represented by a yellow circle with a red line connecting it to the carbon.A red line connects carbon dioxide molecules with a red color. (Note: This is not a complete sentence or instruction, but rather a description of a chemical reaction.)Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of all biological en-ergy. Photosynthesis organisms use the energy to sunlight to manufacture food.Heterotrophic cells use energy from sunlight to produce organic products such as glucose and other organic products, which they use as energy and carbon sources.Life originated on Earth through the theory of spontaneous generation, which suggests that if food was left to rot, it would generate living organisms like microbes.Maggots and higher organisms like rats were disproven by Louis Pasteur, who argued that life only comes from life.Darwin's theory of evolution suggested that simpler life forms led to complex organisms, while the Oparin-Haldane theory of abiogenesis (1929) suggests that life only comes from life.The Oparin-Haldane theory of abiogenesis proposes that organic molecules could be formed from abiotic materials in the presence of energy (lightning, heat, and UV-light).Under reducing conditions of early Earth's atmosphere, Oparin's primordial soup was caused by abiogenic factors above in water.Biomolecules (amino acids, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates) needed to form cells, which are the primary constituents of life. These theories were only speculations without proof.Image 1 shows a tree with different types of plants and animals divided into sections, each representing a different type of plant.The top section of the tree has different types of animals, including birds, reptiles, mammals, amphibians, land plants, and seaweed.

The fifth section is described as \"Increasing role of RNA.\"The fifth section discusses the increasing role of peptides in RNA replication, coevolution of RNA and protein, and the sixth section focuses on the primative translation system that develops with RNA genome and protein.Translation system uses RNA genome and RNA-protein catalysts to translate RNA into a specific target protein.The label at the bottom of the flowchart indicates that genetic RNA is copied into DNA, which is related to DNA genome translation and protein catalysts.I'm sorry, I cannot summarize an image without knowing which image you are referring to. Please provide more information or context.The image shows a table showing eukaryotes and their properties. The table is divided into two columns, with the left column representing the number of different species.The number of different species of organisms and the right column representing their characteristics are represented in a table or a chart.The first column discusses the diversification of multicellular eukaryotes and the second column describes the appearance of red and green algae.Green algae is a type of algae that is characterized by having a green color and a spherical shape. They are typically found in a variety of habitats, including oceans, lakes, and ponds. Green algae are also known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the water, which is essential for their growth and survival.Protists, the first euaryotes, and the development of O2-rich atmosphere. There are three types of photosynthetic O2 producing cyanobacteria.The table has a section titled \"Formation of oceans and continents\" at the bottom that provides further information about the formation of Earth.Figure 1-38: Evolution of eukaryotes through endosymbiosis, Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry, 6th Ed.Endosymbiosis led to the evolution of modern eukaryotes through the transfer of genetic material from aerobic bacteria to mitochondria.Photosynthesis cyanobacteria became plastids and chloroplasts of green algae, the ancestors of modern plant cells.Image 1 shows a diagram of different types of chromosomes and their functions, divided into four sections.Anaerobic metabolism is a type of bacteria responsible for the formation of nuclei. Nuclei are responsible for storing them in the nucleus.storing nuclei in the nucleus and then released into the cell. Then, the mitochondria are released.The mitochondria converts into a nucleus, which stores and transports the nuclei. The image also shows the mitochondrion as a catalyst.The mitochondrion is a catalyst for cell growth and development, as shown by the given statement. (Note: This statement is not a complete sentence, but rather a summary of the main points of the text.)The image shows four chromosomes with different colors arranged in a circular pattern, representing different stages.The pattern represents the different stages of the cycle, with blue chromosomes representing the nucleus, green chromosomes representing photosynthetics, and the white chromatid representing the cycle. Each stage has a different color.Chromosomes are the white chromosomes that represent chloroplasts, which are the cells that make up the cell membrane. The diagram also includes text explaining the process of photosynthesis and how it occurs.Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of chemical reactions that take place in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The glucose produced during photosynthesis is used by the plant for energy and growth, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. 29855\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def process_text_in_sentence_chunks(text, max_chunk_size):\n    tokenizer = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')\n    sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\n\n    current_chunk = \"\"\n    l = []\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence) <= max_chunk_size:\n            current_chunk += \" \" + sentence\n        else:\n              l.append(current_chunk.strip())\n              current_chunk = sentence\n\n    if current_chunk:\n        l.append(current_chunk.strip())\n    return l","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-09T21:16:59.025855Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-09T21:16:59.026741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-09T21:16:59.032724Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-09T21:16:59.026705Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-09T21:16:59.031743Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ls = file_preprocessing(\"/kaggle/input/bsebse/BSE102_Lecture 3_Chemical basis of life.pdf\")\ntext = \"\"\nfor t in ls:\n  text += t\nls1 = process_text_in_sentence_chunks(text,3000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-09T21:26:30.295626Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-09T21:26:30.295980Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-09T21:27:19.048470Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-09T21:26:30.295952Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-09T21:27:19.047660Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"summary_2 = \"\"\nfor u in ls1:\n  result = pipe_sum(u)\n  result = result[0]['summary_text']\n  summary_2 += result","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-09T21:27:19.049903Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-09T21:27:19.050160Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.305973Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-09T21:27:19.050137Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.305183Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(summary_2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.307548Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.307814Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.312511Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.307790Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-09T21:30:28.311549Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"BSE 102 Bioscience Spring 2024: The Chemical Basis of Life Instructor: Dr. Sunil Kumar Boda Assistant Professor Department of Biosciences & Biomedical Engineering IIT Indore Image 1: Logo of Indian Institute of Technology Indore with blue background and white border. Open book with a sunburst design and two lines of text in Hindi. Text below the book reads \"II  \" (Indian Institute of technology Indore) in English. Image 2: Infographic showing the elements of the human body as per-centage of body weight (including water). Image 3: Figure 2.1B showing the percentage of water in each element.The chart includes information about the different elements and their properties. Iodine is an essential component of the hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine produced by the thyroid glands. Iron is vital for energy processing and transport of oxygen. Recommended dietary allowances of trace elements are based on gender (male/female) and age (infants/adults). Image 1 shows an elderly woman from Burma wearing a blue and white headscarf with a pink scarf around her neck. Image 2 shows a variety of food items that are rich in iron, including meat, fish, poultry, eggs, green beans, nuts, and dried raisins.The background is white and there is text on the image that reads \"Figure 2.2C Mouthwash and toothpaste\". There is a white toothbrush and a glass of toothpaste filled with a clear liquid, which appears to be toothpaste with added fluoride. The image also includes a table that lists the different types of dietary deficiencies and their physical functions, including Selenium (S), Zinc (Zn), Copper (C), and other physical functions. Radioactive isotopes can be helpful in dating fossils by C-14 decay, as they uptake both normal and radioactive compounds similarly. Biologists use radioactive tracers to follow molecules during chemical changes in an organism.The image shows two models of a helium atom, a nucleus with two protons and two neutrons, and an electron cloud with two electrons. The image illustrates the relationship between the two models. DNA, not protein, contains the genetic code, which was proven by radioisotope labeling in Griffith's experiment (1928). Radioactivity was found only in the transduced bacteria after E.coli infection by 32P-labeled phage, while radioactivity was only found in the supernatant after the bacteria were removed. The diagram shows the process of heat-treated S and S+R, which shows the different stages of the process, from the initial stage to the final stage.The fourth stage is \"heat treated S\" and is labeled as \"R\". There are smaller yellow spheres scattered throughout the image representing different types of heat treatments that can be used to treat rats. There are three steps in the diagram: 1. Infection 2. Blending 3. Centrifugation 4. After centrifugating no sulfur in cells, there are two circles at the bottom of the diagram.The image shows how bacteria can differentiate between different types of bacteria and how they interact with each other. Radioactive isotopes can also be used to tag chemicals that accumulate in specific areas of the body, such as phosphorus and fluorodeoxyglucose. PET scans can produce images of areas with high metabolic activity, which can be useful for diagnosing certain heart disorders and cancers and for basic research on the brain. However, uncontrolled exposure to high levels of radiation can be lethal, and the particles and energy thrown off by radioactive atoms can damage molecules, especially DNA. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 released large amounts of radioactiveisotopoids into the environment, which led to increased rates of thyroid cancer in children exposed to the radiation.The 2011 post-tsunami Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan is another similar incident. Radon, a radioactive gas, can contaminate buildings in regions where underlying rocks contain uranium. Homeowners can purchase a radon detector or hire a company to test their home to ensure that radones levels are safe. Marie Curie died of aplastic pernicious anemia due to radiation exposure during her work. The Uranium -238 Decay Chain is a periodic table with atomic number 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, chain, and numbers that indicate the atomic decay chain. Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds. Photosynthesis is essential for life on earth.The diagram shows a sun with a carbon dioxide molecule in the center, representing the energy of the sun. The text explains that photosynthesis is the ultimate source of all biological en-ergy, photosynthetic organisms use the energy to sunlight to manufacture glucose and other organic products, which heterotrophic cells use as energy and carbon sources. The theory of spontaneous generation was disproved by Louis Pasteur. The Oparin-Haldane theory of abiogenesis proposed that organic molecules needed for life could be formed from abiotic materials in the presence of energy under reducing conditions of early earth's atmosphere. All above theories were only speculations without proof.The image is labeled with the names of the plants and their habitats. Miller simulated the origins of life on earth by using water representing the oceans, reducing earth's atmosphere consisting of gases like CH4, NH3, H2 and H2O (water vapor). After a week, the water turned brown and contained coacervates of organic biomolecules such as amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, monosaccharides, fatty acids, and glycerol. In one set of experiments, Miller included H2S from atmosphericvolcanoes, which accounted for the formation of sulfur containing amino acids and subsequent disulfide links in proteins. The process of electrical spark lightning proved the Oparin-Haldane chemical origin of life.The first cell probably used inorganic fuels produced by chemosynthesis for ATP generation: FeS + H2S ---FeS2 + H2. Figure 1-37 is a list of landmarks in the evolution of life on earth, including the development of life stages, the acquisition of replicative ability, the transition from lifeless chemicallytransition to self-replicating systems, biological evolution, eukaryotes, multicellularity, plants, animals, and metabolic evolution.The article discusses the appearance of protists, the first euaryotes, and the development of O2-rich atmosphere. It also mentions three types of photosynthetic O2 producing cyanobacteria. The article also provides information about the formation of Earth and the evolution of eukaryote organisms through endosymbiosis.
